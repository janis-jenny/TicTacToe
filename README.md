# TicTacToe - How to play

>1 - The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.<br/>
2 - You are X, the computer in this case is O.<br/>
3 - Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.<br/>
4 - The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.<br/>
5 - When all 9 squares are full, the game is over.<br/>
6 - If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.<br/>
7 - Alright! Now you are able to continue, let's start the game!<br/>
