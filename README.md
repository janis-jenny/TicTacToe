# TicTacToe Rules

>The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
You are X, the computer in this case is O.
Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
When all 9 squares are full, the game is over.
If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
Alright! Now you are able to continue, let's start the game!
